# 🖥️ Harmony Aura: Supervisor Dashboard

The Harmony Aura Web Dashboard is a premium React application designed for mission-critical industrial overwatch. It focuses on high-density information display, real-time synchronization, and high-end aesthetics.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Industrial Premium"

-   **Glassmorphism**: Clear, semi-transparent layers for depth and hierarchy.
-   **Vibrant Color Theory**:
    -   `#EF4444 (Critical)`: Immediate Danger.
    -   `#F59E0B (Warning)`: Pre-emptive Caution.
    -   `#10B981 (Safe)`: Optimal Operation.
    -   `#06B6D4 (Aura Cyan)`: The primary brand color for telemetry.
-   **Animations**: Leveraging **GSAP (GreenSock)** for smooth data-flicker transitions and layout entries, providing a "Cyberpunk Overwatch" feel.

## 🏗️ Architecture & State

### 1. **Real-time Synchronization**
The application uses the `firebase/database` SDK with custom React Hooks to maintain a low-latency connection:
- `useRealtimeWorkers.js`: Streams all worker biometric data.
- `useRealtimeMachines.js`: Streams machine telemetry and PdM predictions.
- `useRealtimeAlerts.js`: Listens for actionable recommendations generated by the backend.
- `useRealtimeRestRequests.js`: Tracks operator-initiated break requests.

### 2. **Component Structure**
-   `GlobalHeader`: Real-time cumulative fleet health (Critical/Warning/Safe counts).
-   `WorkerCard`: Compact, animated summary of worker bio-states and assigned machine.
-   `ActionableAlerts`: Dedicated triage panel for incoming risk event analysis.
-   `RestRequestPanel`: Workflow management for approving/denying operator breaks.

## 🧠 Functional Logic: CIS Visualizer

The dashboard re-calculates the **Composite Intelligence Score (CIS)** in real-time to provide visual redundancy to the backend logic.
- **Normalization Engine**: Converts raw sensor data (BPM, ms, °C) into linear risk gradients (0-1).
- **Calibrated Thresholds**: Aligned with the `Worker` and `Machine` profiles defined in `backend/models.py`.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_url
   ...
   ```
3. **Run Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Build Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
